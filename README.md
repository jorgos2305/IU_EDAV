## Course: Explorative Data Analysis and Visualization (DLBDSEDAV01)
Welcome to the repository of the EDAV course.
The task for this project consists in selecting a dataset, showing how it can be visually explored and to gain insights from these visuals as how we should work with it.

### Objectives

The objectives of this project are:
1. To select a dataset of interest
2. To demonstrate and apply the descriptive statistic tecniques learned during the course to describe location, variance, covariance, etc.
3. To create visualizations to highlight interesting aspects of the dataset
4. To describe technical and creative choices (This part is contained only in the written assignment)
